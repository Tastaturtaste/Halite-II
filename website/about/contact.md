## NEED HELP PLAYING HALITE?

If you get stuck while playing Halite, we suggest you check out our [community forums](https://forums.halite.io){:target="_blank"} to see what other players are discussing and to see if others have had your problem before. If you don't see your question answered, feel free to start a new thread! There's also a lively conversation on the [Discord chat](https://discordapp.com/invite/EqW8DCB){:target="_blank"}.

We've put a lot of the most common questions about the Halite competition into our [FAQ][FAQ] page. We hope this page can quickly get you answers to your questions.

The Halite team is also here to help if you have any questions, although turnaround may be a bit slower than other methods - we're a small group and we're quite inactive now that the competition has ended. You can email us at <mailto:halite@halite.io>. This includes everything from technical support to press inquiries.

And not that anything serious will go wrong (fingers crossed), but to receive notifications about technical maintenance or issues, you can subscribe to our [status page](https://halite.statuspage.io){:target="_blank"} to get the latest updates and incidents.

## CONTACT OUR PARENT

For questions related to anything non-game related like legal issues, you can contact our parent company, [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com){:target="_blank"}.
