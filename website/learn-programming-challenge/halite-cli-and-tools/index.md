Some awesome toys and APIs for you to be super productive while playing Halite. You can see all game server code in the [Halite II open-source repo](https://github.com/HaliteChallenge/Halite-II). To play offline, you can also play against the top player bots that have been open-sourced. See our [community resources](/other-resources/community-resources)
